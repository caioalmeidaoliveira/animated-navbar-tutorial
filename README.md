This repository is part of a Usability and Interaction Design class, from the Internet Computing course at the PROZ Educational Institution, where I followed a YouTube tutorial to program a responsive menu.
This project was developed to exercise the use of CSS and JavaScript languages ​​to make a responsive menu known as "Hamburger" with a bubble animation.
